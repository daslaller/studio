  prompt: `You are an AI simulation expert, skilled in providing optimization suggestions for electronic component simulations.

  Based on the following simulation details, provide a list of suggestions to improve the simulation results and prevent component failure. Also include the reasoning behind the suggestions.

  Component Name: {{{componentName}}}
  Cooling Method: {{{coolingMethod}}}
  Maximum Temperature: {{{maxTemperature}}} Â°C
  Cooling Budget: {{{coolingBudget}}} W
  Simulation Results: {{{simulationResults}}}

  Consider adjustments to the cooling method, frequency, voltage, or other relevant parameters.
  Format your response as a list of suggestions, followed by a detailed reasoning section.

  Example:
  Suggestions:
  - Reduce the frequency by 10% to lower heat generation.
  - Upgrade the cooling method to liquid cooling for better heat dissipation.

  Reasoning: Reducing the frequency will decrease power consumption and heat generation. Upgrading to liquid cooling will provide significantly better thermal performance, allowing the component to operate at higher power levels without exceeding the maximum temperature.
